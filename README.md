# Paid Campaign Analysis

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to mimic the workflow of a data analyst or business analyst. As a data/business analyst, the ability to explore data, solve problems, and generate actionable insights is an important skill to possess. So, in this project, I intentionally put these skills into practice and demonstrated my ability to leverage data to make decisions.

### Problem Statement

JIFNA Inc. (the company's shopping mall) ran several  paid ads in July and November 2021. The company wanted to improve its marketing strategies to better understand customer engagement with its products and services. Additionally, the company wants to know whether the campaign is profitable  and what types of ads perform best. Therefore, the  data department will analyze the collected data, identify patterns and trends in customer behavior to improve marketing strategies.

### Goals

- Develop dashboards that let the marketing team track and assess which campaigns and advertisements are doing the best for the business.
- Monitoring the dashboard to optimize and adjust campaigns to improve performance and achieve desired result’s trend by the time.
- Produce knowledge/insights on the preferences and buying habits of customers.

### Flowchart

  Marketing managers are the primary users of this dashboard. Users are interested in the results of each advertising campaign performed so they can judge whether the marketing model is successful and profitable and should be kept going or should be stopped. The developed dashboard can accommodate marketing managers' needs.

### Insights & Analysis Exploration

#### 1. What are the overall ad cost, revenue and P&L

   From July to November, the corporation spent $635K USD on advertising. Unfortunately, the company’s revenue generated lower than advertising expenses. As a result, the  analysis will be concentrated on the month in which the company turned a profit.

   As previously stated, the corporation only made a profit in October. A deeper examination reveals that the profit was generated mostly by the 'mobile' device.

#### 2. Cost, revenue, and P&L by ad type

  ![3](https://github.com/MuhammadFakhrurradhi/Tableau-Paid-Search-Campaign/assets/131879017/ea1645b5-04f7-407d-b460-3c0ded6e9f03)
  
  ![4](https://github.com/MuhammadFakhrurradhi/Tableau-Paid-Search-Campaign/assets/131879017/6da82bc8-4225-4c76-8b43-c6c63405372a)

  The discount and promo ad campaign, as seen above, earned earnings for a certain month (October) and device (Mobile).

#### 3. In terms of customers awareness, how are the ad campaigns performing?

  ![5](https://github.com/MuhammadFakhrurradhi/Tableau-Paid-Search-Campaign/assets/131879017/5308fc89-1173-4506-8d5a-f5eb5c9962f5)

  As shown above, the 'Coupon' ad-type campaign delivers the greatest impressions and clicks when compared to 'Promo' and 'Sale'. In terms of average cost per mille, it appears that the 'Coupon' ad type campaign outperforms the 'Promo' ad type campaign.

#### 4.In terms of customers consideration, how are the ad campaigns performing?

  ![6](https://github.com/MuhammadFakhrurradhi/Tableau-Paid-Search-Campaign/assets/131879017/932c1c91-895f-4e2e-89b2-f5112ac16838)

  'Coupon,' 'Promo,' and 'Discount' are the most popular ad types, with higher Click Through Rates. In terms of average cost per click, 'Promo' is in second position ($1.02), while 'Coupon' is in fourth place. This leads to the conclusion that the 'Coupon' ad type campaign is the best choice for the campaign, since it is lower in Avg. CPC and higher in Avg. CPM.

#### 5. In terms of customers conversion, how are the ad campaigns performing?

  ![7](https://github.com/MuhammadFakhrurradhi/Tableau-Paid-Search-Campaign/assets/131879017/4803ff43-3dac-44ea-9a30-a53d21eb8a10)

  According to the image above, the 'Black Friday' ad type campaign is significantly outperforming the average conversion rate due to the November black-friday event, which also contributes to the monthly conversion trend. However, it does not make a meaningful contribution to the remaining measures.

#### 6. How are the overall campaign performances?

  ![8](https://github.com/MuhammadFakhrurradhi/Tableau-Paid-Search-Campaign/assets/131879017/2a92b89e-28a2-4d5b-9330-8a2913174830)

  Overall, 'Coupon' and 'Promo' earned the most sales with their ad type campaigns, despite spending the most money on advertising. However, during the October period, particularly for 'mobile' devices, both of them generated significant profit for the company.


### Conclusion

- The marketing manager can apply this analysis for future campaigns by focusing on 'Coupon' and 'Promo' ad types, particularly on 'mobile' devices that generated higher impressions or CTR, implying more customer interaction.
- The marketing and data division should review their dashboard on a frequent basis to ensure they maximize profitability and efficiently reach their target audience by modifying their advertising approach and spending as needed.
